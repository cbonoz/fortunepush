'Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personalrisk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace ofmind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the moreuseless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is,the vaster and more potent hope becomes. Hope never makes sense. Hope isweak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes inits powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hopeknows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited onall of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. Thisis the secret of hope\'s power. Hope demands for others what we demand forourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemyour own face. Chris Hedges',
